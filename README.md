# SMPCWemRenaming

This is mostly just required for editing voicelines

1) Put the TXTP files that you want the WEM names extracted from into "Collect Base 10 Names from TXTP\TXTPs"
2) Run "Base10FromTXTP.bat"
This will create a "result.txt" with all WEM names found in those TXTP files. The text file will include more than just the WEM names so will need some cleaning up
